# This is my portfolio site. 

The idea for it is to have a "programmer" feel to it, since i really love programming :)


## some things I want:

1. To allow users to type out paths by doing "cd about/" or "cd projects" similar to a terminal emulator
2. I want to give the colours and style of this site very simplistic vibes, but in a way to be similar to terminal
(maybe every command starts with $ or something.)
3. I could make TS compare the input value you have so it can perform an action
4. because this is input heavy, it would be important to sanitize inputs so they are still safe to use( mayde use antd?)
